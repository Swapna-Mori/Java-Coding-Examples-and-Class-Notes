-- Using IN and NOT In Operators in WHERE Clause
--  Write a subquery to get list of shipped date and status of books 
		-- that are available in library

-- Writing sub queries using comparision operators
 SELECT * FROM bookorder WHERE booknumber = ANY(

-- Exists subquery should contain any reference column
-- it must be a correlated subquery

-- Exists subquery is used to test whether a sub-query returns at
