Interfaces with only one abstract method we call those interfaces as marker interface.

Example
==========
Comparator in java.util
Runnable interface in java.lang et.

In Java8 they have introduced a package called java.util.function is a subpackage in java.util package 
which contains group of marker interfaces which are called as functional interfaces

 functional interfaces
==================
Interfaces with only one abstract method from Java 8 these interfaces are called as Functional Interface

can we have default and static methods in the functional interface?
yes

how to mark this interface as functional interface?
using annotation @FunctionalInterface to restrict with only one abstract method

There are two types of functional interfaces which are predefined and userdefined

For userdefined functional interfaces we use @FunctionalInterface to mark it as functional interface

For predefined functional interfaces we can refer to  java.util.function package which contains group of predefined
functional interfaces.

Advantages of functional Interface in java
==================================
we can use this interfaces to write lambda expression instead of using bulky anonymous class implementation


what is  anonymous class?
A class with out name and used to implement a single abstract method interface before java 8.

lambda expression in java 8
=======================
A block of code which can be used to implement functional programming in java from java 8 version
instead of writing the bulky anonymous class for implementing single abstract method interface

(parameters) -> expression


Advantages of Lambda Expression
=============================
Reduces number of lines of code
Sequential and Parallel Execution Support
Passing Behaviours into methods

Write a  java proigram to filter all strings in an arraylist which are starting with "s"?

Write a java program to remove duplicated from list of strings

Method References:
================
to refer method of functional interface in compact and easy form.

Method References applied for 3 types of methods

1. static
2. instance
2.constructor
