Introduction To Servlet
===================
Servlets are server side programs where you can collect the data from web page in the form of forms and saves the data in the database.

Example: Register Page,Login Page,Apply Job etc.,

Two Types of Validations happen while developing an application

1.  Front end validations
=====================
HTML,CSS and validations on these code will be written using JavaScript

password must be greater than 8 character
is checkbox enabled
required fields etc., 

2. Back end validations
===================
Java Code is used for backend validations

Register => The e-mail address you entered has already been registered.
Login => if user not exists,Login failed. Please check your credentials.

Servlets plays a key role for adding these validations while developing an application using java
Servlets are used for dynamic web pages
HTML,CSS and JS are used for static web pages

static web pages => websites => college websites or company websites etc.,
dynamic web pages => facebook,instagram,amazon,twitter,email etc.,

javax.servlet

Before Servlets
=============
CGI
====
Common GateWay Interface
=========================
disadvantage of CGI
=================
CGI creates multiple objects for multiple requests to the CGI code so it increases the load and decreases the performance of the application

Advantage of Servlet over CGI
=========================
Servlet process the multiple requests using same object but with help of different threads
Security
Scalability
reliability etc.,

Practice Program
===============
Write a servlet code to read data from AddProduct.html page(productid,productname,productprice,productbrand,productcategory) and read that data in to database using servlet code
