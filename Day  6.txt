Exception Handling is important to continue program execution after an exception caught and handled.
The execution of program does not terminate when an exception occurs
once the exception is resolved then program execution continues till complete

Exceptional Handling is important because to main the normal and expected flow of the
program when some unwanted events occur.
If not programs may crash or requests may fail.


Creating CustomExceptions in java
=============================
Rules for Java Exception
====================
The user-defined exception class should extend the Exception class


When we create CustomExceptions whether it is RuntimeException or compiletimeException?
compiletimeException when extending the Exception class
RuntimeException should extend the RuntimeException class


ArrayofObjects and Exceptions Practice
===================================
Write a Java program to create product class with productId,productName,productPrice,productCategory
and create an array of products
search for a product by accepting productid from user if not found throw an exception called
ProductNotFoundException
If already product id exists throw an exception called ProductId already exists


Annotations
==========
Annotations are metadata sent to compiler.

There are five types :

1. Marker Annotations 
======================
To mark a declaration.do  not contain any data or any members
Example:
========
@Override => is used to mark a method that it is overriden from interface or abstract class or super class
,@Test => a method declared using this annotation is considered test case

2. Single Value Annotations
==========================
This annotation contains only one member.They allow short hand for specifying value of a member
@Test("testingAddition")
@Entity(Tablename = "Student")

3. Full Annotations
================
Annotations which consist of multiple data members or names,values etc.,
Example:
========
@Column(columnname = "studentId" , nullable = false)

4. Type Annotations
==================
type annotation can be applicable in any place in the class.
@Target annotation can be used for declaring where we can use this annotation

5. Repeating Annotations
=====================
@Repeatable annotation is an example which contains an array of the field


Rules for while using annotations
==================================
1. annotations are not terminated by ;
2. annotations startswith @
3. annotations names are like class names in java
4. annotations are applied on class or method etc., during RUNTIME or Compile time or Source etc.,

Annotations are defined in java.lang package

We can create our own annotation in java

StandardAnnotationsInJava used in java code
======================================
@Override
@Deprecated
@Suppresswarning

StandardAnnotationsInJava used in another annotations
==============================================
@Target
@Documented
@Inherited

Benefits of Annotation
======================
instructions to compiler
@Retention(value=RUNTIME/SOURCE/CLASS)

Points to be noted while creating custom annotation
===========================================
1. we should use @ before interface keyword to define an custom annotation
2. we can specify default if value is not provided then it considers default value


Practice program
==============
Create an annotation with the same checksalary
apply it on the getsalary method of EMployee


Collections in Java
================
Array in Java is static in size
means

int[] a = new int[10];

int 4 bytes  => 95 * 4 = 389 bytes are wasted

and stored only 5 values 100 bytes

Collections are useful for creating dynamic data structures to store objects and delete objects or modify the objects
Collections in java allocates the memory for objects dynamically

Collection is an Interface
=====================
List => ArrayList,Vector,LinkedList
Set => HashSet,LinkedHashSet
SortedSet => TreeSet
Queue => PriorityQueue 

Map interface =>HashMap,HashTable,LinkedHashMap
SortedMap => TreeMap

The above Classes and interfaces are defined in java.util package

Collections are used to store any and only objects .
Collections are not allowed to store primitive data types

 ArrayList
========
ArrayList is dynamic array to store and manipulate objects 
ArrayList internally uses array

ArrayList Default capacity is 10

int newCapacity = (oldCapacity *3)/2 + 1 in Java 6
it increases by 50% of oldcapacity from Java 7
int newCapacity = oldCapacity + (oldCapacity >> 1) in java 7

add(objectName) => to add objects in to ArrayList
remove(objectName) => to remove objects from the ArrayList

when only one or two objects are removed it will shift the remaining objects to fill the gaps
