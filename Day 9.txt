JDBC
=====
Java DataBase Connectivity
======================

1. Register Driver Class
2. Establish Connection
3. Create Statement
4. Execute Statement
5. Fetch Result
6. Close the DB Connection

4 - types of Drivers
================

1. JDBC -ODBC Bridge Driver ( Java 8 API it has been removed) (Type 1)
2 . Native Driver (Type 2) => C and C++ 
3. Network Protocal Driver (Type 3) => Pure Java Driver
4. Thin Driver (Type 4) => Pure Java Driver => DB dependent

ojdbc.jar => Oracle
mysqlconnector.jar => MySqL
etc.,


JAR
===
Java ARchive  files (group of .class files that are used to deploy on client side)
WAR
=====
Web Archive Files (group of .class files and libraries that are deployed on client site or production server)

JDBC API (API is Application Program Interface  =  set of classes + interfaces and Exceptions)

ODBC => Open DataBase Connectivity


java.sql.ResultSet
=================

A table of data representing a database result set, which is usually generated by executing a statement that queries the database. 


java.sql.Statement
===================
The object used for executing a static SQL statement and returning the results it produces



java.sql.DriverManager
========================
The basic service for managing a set of JDBC drivers. 


java.sql.Connection
=================
A connection (session) with a specific database. SQL statements are executed and results are returned within the context of a connection. 


Class<?> java.lang.Class.forName(String className) throws ClassNotFoundException
========================================================================
Returns the Class object associated with the class orinterface with the given string name. Invoking this method isequivalent to: 

Class.forName(className, true, currentLoader) 
where currentLoader denotes the defining class loader ofthe current class. 
For example, the following code fragment returns theruntime Class descriptor for the class named java.lang.Thread: 

Class t = Class.forName("java.lang.Thread") 

A call to forName("X") causes the class named X to be initialized.
Parameters:className the fully qualified name of the desired class.Returns:the Class object for the class with thespecified name.Throws:LinkageError - if the linkage failsExceptionInInitializerError - if the initialization provokedby this method failsClassNotFoundException - if the class cannot be located.



Connection java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(String url, String user, String password) throws SQLException
=========================================================================================
Attempts to establish a connection to the given database URL.The DriverManager attempts to select an appropriate driver fromthe set of registered JDBC drivers


Statement java.sql.Connection.createStatement() throws SQLException
==========================================================
Creates a Statement object for sendingSQL statements to the database.SQL statements without parameters are normallyexecuted using Statement objects. If the same SQL statementis executed many times, it may be more efficient to use a PreparedStatement object.


ResultSet java.sql.Statement.executeQuery(String sql) throws SQLException
===============================================================
Executes the given SQL statement, which returns a single ResultSet object. 


boolean java.sql.ResultSet.next() throws SQLException
====================================================

Moves the cursor forward one row from its current position.A ResultSet cursor is initially positionedbefore the first row; the first call to the method next makes the first row the current row; thesecond call makes the second row the current row, and so on. 

how to add jar file to classpath in sts eclipse
=====================================

1. Right click on your project.
2. Select Build Path.
3. Click on Configure Build Path.
4. Click on Libraries and select Add External JARs.
5. Select the jar file from the required folder.
6. Click and Apply and Ok.


Practice Program
=================
create a database "jdbcexample"
create a table MovieDetails with following attributes
movieid autoincrement pk
moviename
movielanguage
movietype
movierating

create above table using JDBC
Create a Java program to perform insertmovie,deletemovie,updatemovie,moviebyid,showallmovies methods to implement database transactions on above created table

Callable Statement
================
to execute procedures from java program


java.sql.Types
==============

The class that defines the constants that are used to identify genericSQL types, called JDBC types.

Practice Program to Callable Statement
=================================
create a procedure in mysql on above movie table
to accept movieid as IN parameter
to read details of the movie
update the rating of the movie
