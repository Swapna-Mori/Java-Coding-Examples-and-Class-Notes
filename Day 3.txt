Inheritance
==========

enables us to reuse existing code or extend an existing class/type

types of Inheritance in Java
=======================

Single Inheritance 
Multilevel Inheritance 
hierarchial Inheritance 

Points to be noted:
================
private and static methods cannot be inherited
constructors cannot be inherited
final methods cannot be inherited
final classes cannot be inherited

Methods in Java
==============
Dividing a complex problem in to smaller chunks to understand and reusing

Two Types of Methods in Java
============================
User defined Methods :
==================
developer create this type of methods based on requirements

Pre Defined methods or Standard Library Methods
==========================================
These are built in methods in Java Library and readily available for use
Example: nextInt(),nextFloat() etc.,

Syntax
======
returnType methodName(parameterlist){
//method body
}

returnType 
=========
int
float
String or any Object etc., 
it specifies the return value from the method

methodName
===========
Name of the method is an identifier that is used to refer the method in a class or program

methodBody
==========
it includest statments for a particular tasks,The method body should be enclosed in { }

(parameterlist) 
=============
values passed to complete the task

Example
=======
int readDetails(){ //method signature => returntype + methodname(parameter list)
     int i = 10;
return i;
}


Points:
======
variables which defined inside the method called as local variables and must be initialized

Scope of local variable and parameter
=================================
	void printValue(int data) {//data here is parameter
		int d = 0;//local variable
		System.out.println(value + d);
	}//d is local variable which will be available after this bracket
(localvariables and parameter scope is inside the method it is declared)

Methods are further divided into 
===========================
Instance Methods => Methods that are copied inside the object and called using objectname
class Methods => Methods that are declared using static keyword
Factory Methods => methods that return the class itself

Constructors In Java
==================
Constructors in java are similar to method that is used to invoke an object of the class(indirectly constructor invokes the class)

It allocates the memory for the class

A Constructor has the same name as the class name and do not have any return type

if Constructor is not provided by the developer Java Compiler add a default constructor at run-time to the program.

Constructor is called while creating an object of the class
(Constructors are invoked implicitly when you instantiate objects)

Constructors cannot be inherited

Then if we need to call super class constructor then?

Can we multiple constructors in a class?
yes,but number of parameters or type of parameters should be different

Constructors are called at run-time

Note 1:constructors cannot be overriden
Note 2:


Three types of constructors
=======================
1.  default constructor
2. paramaterised constructor
3. copy constructor
================
Copy Constructor is easier to use when our class contains a complex object with several paramaters

What are the access specifiers accepted for constructor?
a) ALL (answer)
b) private
c) protected
d)public
e)default


this
====
this is like a pointer to the current class

variable
method
constructor

this keyword can be used only for instance variables
to qualify instance variable in the constructor while copying data


super keyword
============
this keyword is like a pointer to the super class

variable
method
constructor => super class constructor will be called if there is no default constructor if not it shows following error
"Implicit super constructor A() is undefined. Must explicitly invoke another constructor"

what is constructor overloading?
adding parameters to the constructors is called as constructor overloading


What is constructor chaining?
calling the constructor inside another constructor explicitly using super or this keyword

Access Modifiers
=============
affects the code that is visible to different class in hierarchy

we have 4 types of modifiers in java

1.Public  (high)
2.Protected (sub class and non packages sub class)
3.Default (package level)
4.Private (only in class)

Access Modifiers or Specifiers are used only for Instance Variable 

Private:=
========
private keyword is used to declare the data to restrict the changes to the data
if variable or method is declared as private we can only access it inside the same class
(visibility of members will be in the same class).

Can we access private data members outside of class?
yes,using getters and setters

example of private
================
private int id;

setId()
getId()

2.Protected
=============
Protected Class members can be accessed only in sub class/(es).

if a subclass is in different package?

yes we can access protected data members in another class which is declared in another package,but it should
be sub class of it.

Class members = properties/variables/data + methods
