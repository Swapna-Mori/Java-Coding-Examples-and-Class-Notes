HashSet
=======

HashSet in Java store only unique values i.e. no duplicates are allowed.
HashSet works on concept of hashing i.e.,
     hashfunction(an unique code) is calculated using value that is stored and generates the code that is unique to store the objects in HashSet.
When we have same value to store in any of Set classes it will generate the same code for the two same objects

HashSet internally uses HashMap to store the values 


HashMap
========
HashMap is a concreteclass which implements Map interface
HashMap store values using key,value pair

HashMap<key,value> empData = new HashMap<key,value>();

HashMap works on principal of hashing.

what is hashing?
which generates unique code called hashcode

put() method is used to add data in to HashMap by using (hashing) on key value
the following statement helps to understand that if two values are stored using same key old values will be replaced with new one.
===================
put() method Associates the specified value with the specified key in this map.If the map previously contained a mapping for the key, the oldvalue is replaced.

put() method uses equals and hashcode to compare two keys while adding new entry in to the HashMap

We can duplicate values but not keys in HashMap.
We can store more than one null value but only one key can be null

get() method is used to retrieve the data using keys.
Once get() method is executed using a key object it generates hashcode and executes equals method to find reference bucket where data is stored

ArrayList,Vector,HashSet all have fail fast iterator .
fail-fast iterator  throws ConcurrentModificationException (i.e., if you are modifying the structure of the collection by adding or removing while iterating)
fail-safe iterator  doesnot throw any exception

fail-fast iterator  works on original collection
fail-safe iterator  copy of original collection

fail-fast iterator provides add, remove and set operations
fail-safe iterator doesnot provide such operations
