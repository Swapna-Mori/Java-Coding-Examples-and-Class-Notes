
polymorphism
=============
Poly - n forms
writing the same method in different forms is called as Polymorphism

there are two types of polymorphism:
================================
Method Overriding:
===============
if the same method is present in both the super class and the sub class then sub class method
overrides the super class method

Points to be noted:
================
method overriding is also called as run time polymorphism or late binding or dynamic polymorphism
method overriding can be implemented when two classes are inherited (inheritance/extends keyword is important)
In method overriding JVM decides which method to call at runtime based on the object called so it is called as runtime polymorphism
Cannot reduce the visibility(access specifiers) of the inherited methods (only inherited methods with same signature can be overriden)


Method Overloading
===================
if the same method is present in both the same class or super class but differs in the parameter list then it is called as  method overloading.

Points to be noted:
================
method Overloading is also called as compile time polymorphism or early binding or static polymorphism
method Overloading can be implemented when two classes are inherited or in the same class
In method Overloading JVM decides which method to call at compile time based on the method signature  so it is called as compiletime polymorphism
Can reduce the visibility(access specifiers) of the methods
